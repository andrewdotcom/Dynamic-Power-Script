Dynamic Power Script

Created by Andrew Skinner | http://www.andrewskinner.name

This script monitors the health of the UK National Grid and modifies the OS X Power Management settings accordingly. Surplus power and disks stay active longer, the screen saver takes longer to kick in etc. A power deficit and the reverse happens.

The script is fully configurable.
